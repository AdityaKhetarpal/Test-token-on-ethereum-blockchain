# Test-token-on-ethereum-blockchain

`Prerequisites` to build a token on Ethereum Network -:

1.`Remix IDE` - to write and deploy our code

2.`OpenZeppelin` - Ethereum Network supports EVM so we will use ERC-20 standards

3.`MetaMask` - to interact with the Ethereum Network

4.`Quick Node` - to interact with Ethereum Testnet (also called Ethereum Goerli)

5.Some ETH tokens - which we can get from the faucet
